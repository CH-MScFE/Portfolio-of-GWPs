**Underlying approach**
One team member submits the following on behalf of the entire group:
1. 1 PDF document* of all writing EXCLUDING code
○ Make sure that the write-up is a cohesive, well-organized text instead of
simply a question-and-answer format.
○ Your report should be professional and on par with what you are expected
to deliver in a professional setting.
○ Your visualizations should align with the text and help the reader
understand your point. All plots/graphs should be numbered and properly
captioned.
○ You are trying to convince your team that your proposal is indeed the
correct approach. You are expected to make your point clear to the reader
by using inference, theory, backtesting, and additional evidence.
○ You must provide a theoretical justification for your methods (cite
econometric or statistical theory) where applicable.
○ Ensure one voice: sometimes group projects read like multiple authors.
Use consistent tense and writing style.
○ Do not include code or screenshots of large data tables in your report. The
report should emphasize reasoning, explanations, and the presentation of
results, rather than being cluttered with raw Python code.
○ Use the available Report Template and fill out the required information on
the first page
2. A zipped folder including:
○ An executable Jupyter notebook** that includes the code, its output, and
the answer to each question. Make certain that you compile the code of all
group members into ONE Jupyter notebook before submitting.
○ A duplicate version of the Jupyter notebook above in PDF or HTML format.
In order to include the output of the code, you must RUN the code before
downloading the PDF.
